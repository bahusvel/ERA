Entropy Reduction Attack - attack on encryption technologies that dynamically decrypt and re-encrypt data exposing cleartext over time 


This tool is designed to identify clear text memory where it is partially decrypted, specifically against anti reverse engineering or anti tamper strategies that invole decrypting and re encrypting the memory pages dynamically while the program executes.
